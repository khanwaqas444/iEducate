            <p class="sectionTag te text-small">The school education system in India is vast and complex. It is overseen
                by three national bodies: The All India Council for Technical Education, the University Grants
                Commission, and the National Council of Educational Research and Training. In addition to these, each
                state has its Department or Ministry of Education, which regulates school education within its
                jurisdiction.

                In India, the literacy rate for people aged seven and above is 74.04%. The male literacy rate is 82.14%
                while the female literacy rate is 65.46%. The Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) for higher education in India
                is 26.30%. The GER is the percentage of people aged 18-23 who are enrolled in higher education
                institutions. In India, there are more than 700 universities and 37000 colleges.</p>

            <p class="sectionTag te text-small">School education in India starts at the age of three with pre-primary
                school. Pre-primary school is not compulsory and is not part of the formal education system. The
                pre-primary stage is followed by five years of primary schooling, which is divided into two cycles of
                two years and three years. After the completion of primary school, children can either attend middle
                school or high school. The middle school comprises Grades VI to VIII, while high school includes Grades
                IX to XII. Upon successful completion of high school, students can pursue higher education at a
                university or college.</p>

            <p class="sectionTag te text-small">To conclude, the education system in India has a long way to go before
                it can be considered truly effective. However, many initiatives are being undertaken by the government
                and various other organisations to try and improve the situation. With time and effort, it is hoped that
                India will eventually have an educational system that meets the needs of all its citizens.</p>
